Run the URSIM:
	cd to ~/ursim.

Autocomplete:
	If the file that you want to run / dir that you want to cd to exists, you can use auto complete to get to it.
	To do this, type in some letters of the word and hit tab.
	IE. if i typed <cd h> in a dir that only contains the folder "hello_world", hitting tab would input <cd hello_world> for me.
	
cd to root:
	cd ~

cd out 1 directory:
	cd ..

cd out of directories repeatedly:
	cd ../../..  etc
	
list contents of folder:
	ls
	this wont show hidden contents.

Get to a ros package directory quickly:
	roscd <pack_name>
		ie roscd robot_control_simulation

Stop a program from running safely (interrupt):
	ctrl + c in the appropriate terminal

Force stop:
	ctrl + z

Open new terminal tab:
	ctrl + shift + t
	This opens a new terminal at the path of the previous terminal.
	IE, if the terminal is at ~/catkin_ws/src, your new tab will be too.
	
Making a file executable:
	cd to directory the file is in
	chmod +x file_name

running a single node:
	before running a node, make sure it's configured properly. (follow ros tutorials for help)
	rosrun package_name node_name

running a launch file:
	roslaunch pkg_name launch_file_name
